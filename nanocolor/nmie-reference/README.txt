These files, in particular n-miew3a.for, are provided as reference for the
Mie theory code - the Python implementation is simply a direct translation
of this FORTRAN77 code.

Further, the test suite for the Mie theory code uses this code directly
(through f2py) to ensure that the translation is correct.
